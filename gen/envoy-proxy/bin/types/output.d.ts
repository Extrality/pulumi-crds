         * Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
         * in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
         * Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and

         * have a _very_ good reason otherwise.
         *
         * In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
         * resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
         * targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.
         *
         * Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
         * ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
         * Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
         * implementations.
         *
         * For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
         * used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
         * In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
         * ancestor object referred to in this status.

         * PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
         * associated Ancestor.
         *
         * Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
         * in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
         * Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
         * the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
         * useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
         * SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
         * have a _very_ good reason otherwise.
         *
         * In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
         * resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
         * targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.
         *
         * Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
         * ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
         * Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
         * implementations.
         *
         * For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
         * used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
         * In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
         * ancestor object referred to in this status.
         *
         * Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
         * relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

         * PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an

         *
         * Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
         * in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
         * Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and

         * have a _very_ good reason otherwise.
         *
         * In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
         * resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
         * targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.
         *
         * Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
         * ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
         * Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
         * implementations.
         *
         * For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
         * used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
         * In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
         * ancestor object referred to in this status.

         * PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
         * associated Ancestor.
         *
         * Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
         * in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
         * Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
         * the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
         * useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
         * SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
         * have a _very_ good reason otherwise.
         *
         * In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
         * resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
         * targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.
         *
         * Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
         * ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
         * Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
         * implementations.
         *
         * For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
         * used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
         * In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
         * ancestor object referred to in this status.
         *
         * Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
         * relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.
         *

         * PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
         * associated Ancestor.
         *
         * Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
         * in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
         * Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
         * the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
         * useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
         * SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
         * have a _very_ good reason otherwise.
         *
         * In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
         * resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
         * targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.
         *
         * Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
         * ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
         * Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
         * implementations.
         *
         * For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
         * used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
         * In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
         * ancestor object referred to in this status.
         *
         * Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
         * relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.
         *
         * This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
         * with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

         * PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
         * associated Ancestor.
         *
         * Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
         * in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
         * Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
         * the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
         * useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
         * SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
         * have a _very_ good reason otherwise.
         *
         * In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
         * resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
         * targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.
         *
         * Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
         * ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
         * Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
         * implementations.
         *
         * For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
         * used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
         * In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
         * ancestor object referred to in this status.
         *
         * Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
         * relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.
         *
         * This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
